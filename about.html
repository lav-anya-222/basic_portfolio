    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a third-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student with a strong passion for software development. To deepen my knowledge, I have completed several certifications on Coursera, which have helped me expand my skills beyond my core engineering studies. Learning new technologies excites me, and I am eager to continue exploring the world of software.
Apart from academics, music is an integral part of my life.</p>

<p>I find joy in listening to different genres, which energize and inspire me. Whether it's a calming tune or an upbeat rhythm, music helps me relax and stay motivated throughout the day.
</p>
<p>I also love watching cricket, a sport that keeps me engaged and entertained. Following matches and supporting my favorite teams brings a thrill that I truly enjoy. Balancing my academic interests with my hobbies keeps me driven and well-rounded as I move forward in my journey.
